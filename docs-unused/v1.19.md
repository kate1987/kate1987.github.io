### Feature Enhancements

#### Java Agent: Added Wildcard Support for Class Path Indexing Parameters
 
The latest update to the Java Agent introduces - Wildcard Support for Class Path Indexing Parameters. This enhancement empowers users to exercise finer control over the indexing of Java classes within Lightrun. With this new capability, you have the ability to specify an absolute path with a range of filenames using wildcard characters that adhere to glob patterns. As a result, determining which Java classes can be excluded from indexing is now an effortless task. For more information, see [Java Agent Configuration](https://docs.lightrun.com/jvm/agent-configuration/#additional-command-line-flags).

#### Jetbrains Plugin: Error Handling Enhancements

Customer feedback is invaluable to us, and in this release, we have introduced an intuitive **Error Details** module in the Jetbrains IDE. This is helpful in case you encounter an error while placing a Lightrun action, for example, when an action is placed on a non-executable line of code. It is now accessible by right-clicking on the action icon located in the editor gutter and selecting the **Info** option. This information is tagged by an exclamation mark and includes a clear error description, along with actionable guidance on how to resolve the issue. 

Another example of a type of error that is addressed in the **Error Details** module, pertains to source mismatches between a file and agent sources, or when a file cannot be found. 

We have also integrated a set of Troubleshooting How-Tos into the Error Details module. This enhancement empowers you to address issues with precision, guided by specific problem detection.
