### Feature Enhancements

#### Java, Python, and, Node.JS Agents: PII Redaction Enhancements 

- PII Redaction Now Processes Complex and Nested Objects

    In this release, we have extended the support for PII redaction to nested objects to ensure comprehensive privacy protection within complex data structures, bolstering compliance efforts and minimizing the risk of data breaches. With this update, we've tackled the challenge of masking values within multi-level objects during PII Redaction by Name.

    Please note that when PII redaction is performed on Node.JS and Python languages, the nested objects will be redacted and displayed in the log lines as `REDACTED`. The behavior of the Lightrun Java agent differs, as it consistently masks nested objects higher than level 1 hierarchy with `<Object>`, irrespective of whether PII redaction is enabled or not.

- Enhanced Rendering of Java Maps and Arrays
  
   From version 1.26, Lightrun has also improved the rendering of map and arrays object types.


!!!note
    Due to the latest changes to the PII Redaction feature, it is recommended that you review your current PII rules and adhere to the changes to have a much simpler and streamlined functionality. Feel free to contact your customer support team for any questions or issues that you might have.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed multiple internal bugs and security vulnerabilities in the Lightrun server.
