### Highlights

#### Private System API Keys Support

In Lightrun version 1.23.0, we have introduced private system API Keys with AES-128 encryption. This significant enhancement adds an extra layer of security to the application's communication. With this feature, users can now generate API keys through the Lightrun Management Server, creating a secure authentication mechanism for various application requests. This includes requests to SCIM endpoints and Lightrun Integrations, such as Prometheus integration endpoints. For more information, see [Lightrun System API Keys](/api-keys/).
