### Feature Enhancements 

#### PII Redaction Major Enhancements

- Dedicated Library Containing Lightrun Predefined Regex Patterns
 
    Introducing the dedicated PII (Personal Identifiable Information) Library for streamlined Regex pattern usage. This library was meticulously curated based on industry requirements, offering a comprehensive set of major Regex patterns. This eliminates the need for users to create their own patterns, saving time and effort. The library provides tested patterns, ensuring reliability in PII redaction. Once selected, these patterns are integrated into the user's set of PII rules/templates, enhancing convenience. The Regex patterns are organized according to main categories such as Credit Cards, Financials, General, and Network and will be updated on a regular basis. For more information, see [Set a PII Redaction Pattern using Predefined Patterns](/piiredaction/configure-pii-redaction/#configure-a-pii-redaction-pattern-using-predefined-patterns). 

- Compliance with RE2 Regular Expression Syntax

    We've enhanced the accuracy of PII Redaction by aligning patterns with Google’s RE2 Regular Expression syntax. This ensures a standardized approach to redacting sensitive data across all supported runtimes, enhancing the overall reliability of the redaction process. This change ensures that patterns are written once and apply to all supported runtime languages (Java, .NET, Node.js, and Python), but it is highly recommended to validate the functionality of PII Redaction for your desired patterns to ensure proper behavior.

#### JetBrains Plugin: Expanded Error Handling for Node.js

We're excited to introduce an enhancement tailored specifically for our Node.js developers – Expanded Error Handling for Node.js. As part of our ongoing commitment to delivering top-notch tooling for Node.js, this release builds upon the recent advancements made for Java.

The Error Details module in the JetBrains IDE, provides a focused view of errors encountered during Node.js development. Easily access the Error Details module by right-clicking on the action icon in the editor gutter and selecting the Info option. This is particularly useful for identifying errors when placing Lightrun actions on non-executable lines of Node.js code. Included in the Error Details module are Troubleshooting How-Tos, providing targeted solutions for common Node.js development issues, such as source mismatches and file location problems.

### Bug Fixes

Fixed multiple internal bugs and security vulnerabilities in the Lightrun server.
