## About the Lightrun LogOptimizer(™)

Lightrun LogOptimizer(™) is an automated log optimization solution that allows developers to scan their code for log “wastes”.

The Lightrun LogOptimizer solution is currently shipped with the Lightrun JetBrains plugin and is available to the JetBrains suite of IDEs. The LogOptimizer can scan and provide information about potential logging issues for Java and Node.js projects.
