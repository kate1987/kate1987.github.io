# Lightrun for the Web

Lightrun can be installed on a variety of web-based IDEs, for people who rely on in-platform editors (like [GitLab's Web IDE](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/05/23/the-future-of-the-gitlab-web-ide/#enter-vs-code)) or simply prefer to work in a browser.

The following is the complete list of supported IDEs:

1. [VSCode.dev](https://vscode.dev/) ([docs](vscode/vscode-dev.md)) - Microsoft's hosted, web-based version of VS Code
2. [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) ([docs](vscode/code-server.md)) - allows anyone to run VS Code and access it in the browser
<!-- 3. [JetBrains Projector](https://lp.jetbrains.com/projector/) ([docs](jetbrains-projector/intro.md)) - allows anyone to run JetBrains IDEs and Swing apps remotely over the network -->
