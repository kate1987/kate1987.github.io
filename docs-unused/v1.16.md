!!! imp "Important"
    
    This On-Premise release incorporates features introduced in the preceding versions 1.15.x and 1.16.0 (SaaS).
  
### Highlights

#### Dedicated PII Redaction Templates Per Agent Pool

With the introduction of PII Redaction Templates, Lightrun now supports additional granularity for utilizing PII Redaction effectively. You can either establish a single default PII Redaction template to be applied to all your agents or alternatively create and assign distinct PII Redaction templates for different agent pools. 
For example, if you would like to apply PII Redaction only on a Production environment and not on Development or Staging.

To help you get started with configuring your PII redaction on Agent Pools, we provide a single Default template on the PII Redaction page which serves as a starting point for creating your templates. Note that it does not contain any predefined patterns and is not assigned to any agent pools. For more information, see [Assigning PII Redaction templates to Agent Pools](https://docs.lightrun.com/rbac/agent-pool-pii-redaction/).

#### VSCode and JetBrains Plugins: Action Creation on Multiple Sources

We are excited to announce that you can now select multiple agents and tags as a single source when creating an action directly from your IDE. This option lets you simultaneously apply an action to a custom group of agents and tags, which improves your plugin experience and makes it easier to debug with multiple agents and tags. To learn more, see [selecting multiple sources in VSCode](https://docs.lightrun.com/vscode/vscode-multiple-sources) and [selecting multiple sources in JetBrains](https://docs.lightrun.com/multiple-sources/). 

### Feature Enhancements

#### JetBrains Plugin: Copy and Paste Actions Enhancement

We offer an easy and more efficient way to insert Lightrun actions using 'Copy and Paste' within your JetBrains IDE, which allows developers to easily reuse existing actions in multiple locations within your code. This new functionality applies to all Lightrun action types, including Lightrun [snapshots](https://docs.lightrun.com/snapshots-plugin/), [metrics](https://docs.lightrun.com/metrics/), and [logs](https://docs.lightrun.com/logs/). It simplifies the task of reviving expired actions or duplicating actions which have non-trivial conditions and/or watch expressions.

#### JetBrains Plugin: Edit Metrics Mode Enhancement

You can smoothly edit your existing metrics by simply right-clicking on the metric icon in the editor gutter and selecting the 'Edit' option. This allows you to make adjustments to your metrics actions as needed, ensuring your monitoring and performance tracking remain flexible and adaptable. Note that the edited metric is considered a new action and therefore any data collected prior to editing the action will not be included in the new action. For more information, see [Editing Metrics](https://docs.lightrun.com/metrics/#to-edit-metric-configuration-parameters).

#### VSCode Plugin: Duplicate User Actions Enhancement

Introducing the new `Duplicate` action within your VSCode IDE, which allows developers to easily reuse existing actions in multiple locations within your code. This new functionality applies to all Lightrun action types including Lightrun [snapshots](https://docs.lightrun.com/vscode/vscode-plugin-snapshots/#viewing-and-editing-a-snapshot-configuration), [metrics](https://docs.lightrun.com/vscode/vscode-plugin-metrics/#managing-metrics), and [logs](https://docs.lightrun.com/vscode/vscode-plugin-dynamic-logs/#managing-logs), simplyfying the task of creating non-trivial conditions and/or watch expressions.

#### VSCode Plugin: GoTo Code Line Enhancement 

The Lightrun VSCode plugin's `Go-to-code` line capabilities have been improved. You can now navigate to an action’s code line from the Lightrun Console, Actions tab, and Snapshot Hits tab; we’ve also added the ability to select a code line if an action returns multiple options. To learn more about the Lightrun VSCode plugin, see the [VSCode plugin quick tour guide](https://docs.lightrun.com/vscode/vscode-plugin-quick-tour/).

#### JVM Agent: Gain Java Class Indexing Control

With the introduction of these new parameters, you can now actively control which Java classes will be indexed or not by Lightrun:

- `lightrun_exclude_class_path` : Avoids indexing unnecessary classes that are pointed by the `CLASSPATH` environment       setting.       
This, in turn, helps in reducing unnecessary strain on the CPU and memory when the Java agent is launched.
- `Index_compressed_archives` : Includes not only Java archives, such as JAR, WAR and EAR files, but also compressed archives in 
ZIP format.
- `lightrun_extra_class_path_delimiter` and `lightrun_exclude_class_path_delimiter`: Sets a non-default delimiters to the list set 
in `lightrun_extra_class_path` and `lightrun_exclude_class_path` (respectively).

For more information, see [Java Agent Configuration](https://docs.lightrun.com/jvm/agent-configuration/#additional-command-line-flags).
#### Python and Node.js Agents: Enhanced Large Snapshot Value Capture

We've taken snapshot capturing to the next level by enabling you to now capture large values for Python and Node.js agents. As part of this enhancement, we've raised the default settings to accommodate larger string values. You can also define maximum limits in the `agent.config` file through the introduction of the `max_snapshot_buffer_size`, `max_variable_size`, and `max_watchlist_variable_size` fields. For more information, refer to the relevant Agent documentation:  [Python Agent Configuration](https://docs.lightrun.com/python/agent-configuration/) and [Node.js Agent Configuration](https://docs.lightrun.com/node/agent-configuration/).

#### JetBrains Plugin: Edit Metrics Mode Enhancement

You can smoothly edit your existing metrics by simply right-clicking on the metric icon in the editor gutter and selecting the 'Edit' option. This allows you to make adjustments to your metrics actions as needed, ensuring your monitoring and performance tracking remain flexible and adaptable. Note that the edited metric is considered a new action and therefore any data collected prior to editing the action will not be included in the new action. For more information, see [Editing Metrics](https://docs.lightrun.com/metrics/#to-edit-metric-configuration-parameters).

#### JVM Agent: JDK 20 Support

The Lightrun JVM agent now supports JDK 20 excluding features in Preview status.
