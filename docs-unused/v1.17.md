### Features and Enhancements 

#### Jetbrains Plugin: Error Handling Enhancements

Customer feedback is invaluable to us, and in this release, we have introduced an intuitive **Error Details** module in the Jetbrains IDE. This is helpful in case you encounter an error while placing a Lightrun action, for example, when an action is placed on a non-executable line of code. It is now accessible by right-clicking on the action icon located in the editor gutter and selecting the **Info** option. This information is tagged by an exclamation mark and includes a clear error description, along with actionable guidance on how to resolve the issue. 

Another example of a type of error that is addressed in the **Error Details** module, pertains to source mismatches between a file and agent sources, or when a file cannot be found.
