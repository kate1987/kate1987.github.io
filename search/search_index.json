Its core mission is to empower developers like you to dynamically check for issues and debug your code on the fly, liberating you from the need to predict every imaginable edge case or attempt to recreate unexpected issues in different environments. At the heart of Lightrun are its proprietary Lightrun Actions, which encompass dynamic logs, snapshots, and metrics. These Actions grant you unparalleled access to code-level insights from any line of code, providing invaluable context during exceptions and augmenting your ability to monitor and comprehend code execution across various pathways.</p>"},{"location":"#what-can-i-use-lightrun-for","title":"What can I use Lightrun for?","text":"<p>Lightrun offers code-level deep inspection at the micro-granular level, allowing you to troubleshoot, test, and debug your applications by investigating issues directly from the environment where they are running, whether it's development, staging, or production. No hotfixes, restarts, or redeployment are required. Seamlessly integrating into your personal workflow and toolchain including IDEs and APMs (Application Performance Monitoring), and logging tools, Lightrun facilitates swift code instrumentation and issue resolution.</p> <p>Furthermore, Lightrun eliminates the need for costly developer lifecycle operations like local replication or software version updates merely to incorporate new logs or metrics. By enabling developers to observe and tackle the \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 on the fly, Lightrun delivers unparalleled observability without necessitating redeployment, ensuring maximum efficiency and productivity.</p>"},{"location":"#bridging-the-observability-gap","title":"Bridging the observability gap","text":"<p>Traditionally, exceptions, logs, performance metrics and traces have been embedded in code during the development stage.

Developer-centric Lightrun seamlessly integrates into your development workflow, whether through the Lightrun IDE plugin, using Lightrun's CLI client, or with a wide range of compatible third-party application performance monitoring (APM) and logging tools. All Lightrun instrumentation is added from the IDE or CLI tools you\u2019re already using. Fully transparent code observability You can invoke logs, metrics, and snapshots conditionally from anywhere in your deployed application code. There is no need to replicate the production environment or re-deploy. Guaranteed security Lightrun guarantees the security and privacy of your code with enterprise-level security measures including ISO 27001 certification, encryptions, RBAC and SSO, audit trails, logs, and privacy blacklisting. The Lightrun agent is non-web-based and stateless by design, ensuring that no application code is ever exposed. Non-breakable Add multiple logs, snapshots, counters, timers, function durations, and more without breaking the service and with minimal impact on performance. The Lightrun Sandbox verifies and validates full integrity of your application\u2019s behavior when running with Lightrun actions. Environment agnostic Lightrun operates everywhere: on-premises, in the cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure), for microservices, for serverless architectures, Kubernetes, and more. Debug in any environment across any infrastructure. Pipe anywhere From your IDE, you can pipe Lightrun actions to your favorite logging, analytics, and APM tools. Lightrun seamlessly integrates with multiple monitoring, alerting, and big data capture and analytics platforms, such as Prometheus, Datadog, and Statsd. Contextual tags Lightrun's powerful tagging feature enables you to group active agents according to any criterion such as staging, production, QA, server, division, location, organization and more. You can apply multiple tags in any combination to each agent.

Lightrun supports the integration of dynamic logs into your application's existing logs, maintaining the application\u2019s log format and structure. If your application is configured to send logs to log management tools such as Kibana or New Relic, you can also include dynamic logs in real-time during runtime. These dynamic logs will be piped to those tools along with your application's static logs. For more information, see Dyanmic Logs Overview.</p> <p>The Lightrun agent uses <code>java.util.logging</code> as its logging framework, and integration with the application's logger is achieved by adding a <code>java.util.logging.Handler</code> implementation to the agent. Certain logging frameworks offer built-in handler implementations, for example, SLF4J provides the <code>SLF4JBridgeHandler</code>, which serves as a bridge between the <code>java.util.logging</code> logger and the SLF4J APIs.</p> <p>Before integrating Lightrun logs to your application logger, it is important to understand your application logger configuration, map its hierarchy, and determine the specific level of <code>LoggerConfig</code> within the hierarchy that you wish to be inherited by the Lightrun logger. Notably, <code>Log4J2</code> implements a hierarchy mechanism between <code>LoggerConfig</code> objects.</p> <p>The following diagram illustrates the integration between the Lightrun agent logger and the Application logger through <code>JUL</code> handlers.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"dynamic-log-customization/#before-you-begin","title":"Before you begin","text":"<ul> <li>Prior knowledge of your application's logging configuration is essential for executing the described steps effectively.

last tutorial, we learned how to install Lightrun in Kubernetes at the orchestrator level using an Init Container.  An <code>emptyDir</code> volume was used in the deployment, and a Lightrun agent was downloaded and supplied by the Init Container to the main application via Shared volume.</p> <p>However, using an <code>emptyDir</code> volume for Lightrun installation in a Kubernetes cluster is not always optimal. <code>emptyDir</code> volumes are the simplest types of volumes in Kubernetes; they are created when a pod is created and destroyed when it dies. To use Lightrun with <code>emptyDir</code> volume throughout your entire cluster, you will have to install Lightrun with an Init Container in every pod present in the cluster.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we will learn how to install Lightrun in Kubernetes with another type of volume called persistent volumes.  A persistent volume is a cluster-wide resource that is available to all pods present in the deployment; hence, using a persistent volume instead of an emptyDir volume makes it possible to install Lightrun with an initContainer in a single pod and make it available to every pod in your cluster. We will also demonstrate this by installing a separate Helm chart powered application into our cluster and then supplying a Lightrun agent to the application using our persistent volume resource.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The Lightrun best practice is to install Lightrun directly inside the Docker image itself and not at the orchestrator level or lower infrastructure tiers. As we're an application-level tool, it makes sense for our agents to live next to the application.</p>"},{"location":"persistent-volumes/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>This tutorial assumes that you have:</p> <ul> <li>Installed Minikube on your local machine</li> <li>Started a local Kubernetes cluster</li> <li>Launched the Minikube dashboard</li> <li>Installed Helm on your local machine </li> </ul>"},{"location":"persistent-volumes/#create-a-persistentvolumeclaim","title":"Create a <code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code>","text":"<p>The first step in this tutorial will be to create our persistent volume resource.

Hence, we don\u2019t need to create a <code>PersistentVolume</code> object in this tutorial.</p> <p>To create a <code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code>, add a <code>lightrun-demo.yaml</code> file to your project with the following YAML.</p> <pre><code>kind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\nname: lightrun-volumeclaim\nannotations:\nvolume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: standard\nspec:\naccessModes:\n- ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\nrequests:\nstorage: 10Gi\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>lightrun-demo.yaml</code> file creates a <code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code> using the Minikube dynamically provisioned storage class.

By leveraging the observability features of Lightrun and IBM Instana you will be able to observe the full stack of your production service, encompassing infrastructure, applications, and code-level information, all seamlessly integrated within Instana.  Lightrun allows you to acquire, in real-time, a broad range of performance metrics for timing, synchronization, and business logic. These metrics provide immediate answers for identifying bottlenecks, with minimal impact on performance. </p> <p>Lightrun supports the following metric types:</p> <ul> <li>Counter: Checks how many times a specific line of code was reached.</li> <li>Method Duration: Checks how much time a specific method took to execute.</li> <li>Tic &amp; Toc (Block Duration): Checks how much time any arbitrarily-selected block of code took to execute.</li> <li>Custom Metric: Checks what is the value of any code-level variable over time.</li> </ul> <p>This guide will take you through the step-by-step process of integrating Lightrun and Instana using StatsD.

Note that if you are working with multiple Agent Pools, see Manage PII Redaction Templates for Agent Pools.</p> <p>The following table highlights the various data redaction methods supported by Lightrun, assisting you in choosing that most suitable approach for your requirements. For detailed insights into creating redaction patterns, see PII Redaction Best Practices.</p> Redaction Type Description Example Variable name Data is redacted based on a variable name. Any variables which match the supplied pattern will be excluded from the data Lightrun captures. Adding a pattern <code>apiToken</code> will prevent Lightrun from logging data from any variable which includes <code>apiToken</code> in the variable name. So variables <code>my_apiToken</code>, <code>theOtherapiToken</code>, and <code>someapiTokenVariable</code> will all be redacted. Variable value Data is redacted based on a variable value. The regex pattern is matched to a value, not a variable name. The regex pattern <code>\\b5[1-5]\\d\\d([\\-\\]?)(?:\\d{4}\\1){2}\\d{4}\\b</code> will redact all Mastercard debit or credit card data from Lightrun. <p>Lightrun supports creating PII redaction using one of the following methods:</p> <ul> <li>Configure custom PII redaction patterns:    Depending on your Lightrun subscription, you can apply a single pattern to the default agent pool or create templates for multi-agent environments.<ul> <li>Configure PII Redaction for a single Agent Pool environment: To configure PII redaction in a single-agent pool environment, see Configure PII Redaction.</li> <li>Configure PII Redaction templates for multiple Agent Pools (RBAC required): You have the flexibility to either apply a single template across all agent pools or create specific patterns for individual agent pools.

This includes creating Lightrun actions with the agents in the agent pool, full access to action data, etc. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Privileged Role - The privileged role grants a group the ability to ignore agent quota limitations in addition to the permissions granted by the Standard role. </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>Lightrun roles are predefined and are not editable.</p> <p>As illustrated in the following example, all the users in the organization belong to the Default Agent Pool and are granted the Standard privilege role.

Elevated roles grant group members more privileges than others. A DevOps group might have a standard role, but a single user can be granted an elevated privileged role.

You can control who has access to your Lightrun resources (like agents), how much access they have (I.e., can limit agent quota limitations), and what resources they can access.</p> <p>The benefits of implementing Lightrun RBAC in your organization are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Enhanced Security: Lightrun introduces an enterprise-grade security functionality with the RBAC feature and was designed to enhance both the security and governance of users and agents in your organization.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Efficient Resource Allocation: By assigning roles and permissions with Lightrun RBAC, administrators can ensure that employees can perform their job functions while limiting access to unnecessary resources.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Enforced Separation of Duties: RBAC can help organizations enforce the principle of separation of duties, which is critical for maintaining security and preventing fraud.

For example, you can create a group for your Product team and grant them Privileged access to all agent pools in your organization.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Control access to Agents: By organizing your Lightrun agents into agent pools, you can regulate who has access and the extent of the access to the agent pools using groups and roles.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Allow user groups in your organization to debug independently:Organizing your users and agents into groups and agent pools allows users to debug independently from other users.

When you register a Lightrun account for your organization, you are assigned a default group that comprises every user in your organization.

This strategy eliminates the cumbersome task of managing multiple methods in parallel by allowing administrators to set a single login method from three options: user-defined password, SSO, or Google.\n\nFrom version 1.33, this new feature will be rolled out gradually and will only affect a number of selected customers.\n\nSo what's changed?\n\nWhen you apply the new login method, you will need to select your preferred login method. Until you do that, your existing users will be unaffected and will be able to continue working, as usual. However, the administrator will not be able to add new users until you select your preferred login method.\n\nOnce the administrator selects the preferred login method, users will receive an activation email. Users' history will remain unaffected, and as soon as users reactivate, they will be able to pick up right where they left off.\n\nStay tuned for further instructions as we roll out these changes.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"release_notes/lightrun-release-notes/#feature-enhancements_4","title":"Feature Enhancements","text":"<p>.NET Agent: Concurrent Support for Additional Profiling Tools</p> <p>Lightrun introduces support for profiler chaining in the .NET agent allowing you to run multiple profiling tools simultaneously on the same application or system.
