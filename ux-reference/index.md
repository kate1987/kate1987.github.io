Traditionally, exceptions, logs, performance metrics and traces have always been defined during the development stage. With the advent of the cloud, followed by microservices and serverless architectures, a gap was created between development and the production environment, making it nearly impossible to anticipate production-only issues or reproduce them. 

Lightrun is the first platform to shift observability left, empowering developers with 100% visibility into their code regardless of environment or deployment type, from monolith to microservices. With Lightrun, developers have easy access to exceptions as they occur, and they securely add logs, metrics and traces to production and staging in real time, on demand. 

Lightrun is integrated into the developer workflow, from the IDE to APMs and logging tools; all instrumentation is added from the IDE you’re already using and directly to your running application, eliminating the need to predict every edge case imaginable or reproduce environments that can’t be reproduced, by enabling you to check issues on the fly. 

With this perspective into your code, you can troubleshoot, test and debug your application by investigating issues directly from the environments in which they're running, while they're running, including the development, staging and production environments.
