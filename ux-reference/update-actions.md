## Update, edit, and delete actions

Once you've added an action, you can manipulate it by:

- Viewing its details
- Editing its configuration
- Removing it

###### To work with existing actions

Once you create a snapshot or a metric, the relevant icon appears in the gutter of your code. When you enter a log, it is represented in line with your code. Icons for all of these options appear similar to those in the figure below.

      <img src="/assets/images/plugin-gutter.png" align="left" width="400" alt="Operation Icons" />
      <figcaption>Operation Icons</figcaption>
  </figure>

1. Hover over the relevant icon to view summary information from its tooltip.

2. Click the log icon or right-click any icon in the gutter to edit, delete, and view details.
