# SCIM provisioning using Okta

Lightrun supports using the open standard System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) to:

- Grant users in your company seamless access to the Lightrun Application using their Okta credentials.
- Add, remove, and assign your users in your organization.
- Note that as of version 1.22, our support is limited to pushing new users and profile updates. We do not currently offer support for importing data (from Lightrun to Okta) or managing groups (push or import). 

For more information, see [SCIM provisioning Overview](scim.md).
