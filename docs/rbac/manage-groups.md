# Manage groups in Lightrun with RBAC

In Lightrun, a group represents a collection of users who share specific permissions and access to resources. Groups are a fundamental part of [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/rbac/overview), enabling administrators to efficiently manage user permissions.

## What are groups in Lightrun?

Groups in Lightrun allow administrators to assign and manage permissions for multiple users at once. Instead of setting permissions for each user individually, you create a group and grant it access to specific resources, such as agent pools. This simplifies the process of managing access controls, especially for teams that require the same level of access.

When you create a Lightrun account for your organization, a default group is created, comprising all users within your organization. Users with the System Admin role have the authority to create, manage, and delete groups. They can also delegate group management by assigning Group Admin roles to other users, who can then help manage specific groups.

## Group related-roles overview

Before a user can access agents in an agent pool, they must be part of a group that has access to that agent pool. The level of access a user has depends on the role assigned to their group. In Lightrun, there are two roles: 

- **Standard Role** - The standard role grants regular access to an agent pool. This includes creating Lightrun actions with the agents in the agent pool, full access to action data, etc. 

- **Privileged Role** - The privileged role grants a group the ability to ignore agent quota limitations in addition to the permissions granted by the Standard role. 

!!! note
	Lightrun roles are predefined and are not editable.

As illustrated in the following example, all the users in the organization belong to the Default Agent Pool and are granted the Standard privilege role. However, developers also possess access to Dev- Non-Prod with the Privileged role. Meanwhile, team leaders (TLs) hold the standard role in the Default agent pool but also hold priviledged roles for both Dev-Non-Production and TL-Non-Production enviroments simultaneously.

In addition to the role assigned to a group, individual users can also be assigned elevated roles. Elevated roles grant group members more privileges than others. A DevOps group might have a standard role, but a single user can be granted an elevated privileged role. This elevated privileged role allows them to perform certain actions, like ignoring the preset agent quota limitations, which other group members cannot.
