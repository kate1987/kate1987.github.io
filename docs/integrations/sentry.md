# Integrate Lightrun with Sentry

In this guide, you will learn how to pipe Lightrun events to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) with the Lightrun Sentry integration.

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is a developer-first application performance monitoring and error tracking platform that can help you gain insights, uncover anomalies, solve issues, and learn continuously about your code. With the Lightrun Sentry integration, you can collect events on activities related to the Management Portal, Lightrun plugins, and agents and send the events to Sentry for insights and monitoring.

The following events will be collected from your Lightrun server and sent to your Sentry account when you configure the Lightrun Sentry integration.

- User registration events.
- Agents registration events.
- Lightrun action created or deleted events.
- Agents deleted events.
